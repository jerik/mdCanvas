“Make Love, Not War”

# Problem
- There’s too much war in the world. Still. In 2025.  
- Trillions spent on tanks, drones, and PR campaigns to sell both.  
- Politicians keep confusing “defense” with “offense.”  
- Peace is considered unprofitable and therefore... impractical.  
- People are dying, but markets are growing – so all good?

# Solution
- **Make Love, Not War™** A radically naive, disturbingly hopeful global movement offering a bold alternative to war: emotional intelligence, mutual respect, and occasionally, consensual affection.  Instead of invading countries, we propose invading hearts.
- **Features include:**
- Conflict resolution via dance battles  
- Diplomacy speed-dating for world leaders  
- Free hugs for former arms dealers  
- Emotional literacy for heads of state

# Key Metrics
- Number of dictators replaced by therapists  
- Tanks melted and repurposed as playground slides  
- Decline in global defense budgets  
- Uptick in global oxytocin levels  
- Daily average of “I love you”s per capita

# Unique Value Proposition
“Because launching missiles is easier than meaningful conversation – but we believe in difficult things.”

We’re the only peace movement brave enough to say:  
**Maybe try not bombing each other. Just once. See what happens.**

# Unfair Advantage
- Zero lobbying influence = zero moral compromise  
- Backed by grandmas, poets, and disillusioned UN interns  
- Immune to sanctions – we have no assets  
- Weaponized idealism with nuclear-level sincerity

# Channels
- Whispered in yoga studios and shouted on protest signs  
- Graffiti on the walls of heavily guarded embassies  
- Accidentally trending on TikTok  
- Smuggled into G7 meetings via awkward questions
