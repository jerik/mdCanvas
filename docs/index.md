# mdCanvas
Create a Lean Canvas out of a markdown list 

Currently only working on Firefox. New Version is in development. 

## Example
Examples are available: 

- [leanCanvas]( mdCanvas.html ) with [startup file: mdCanvas.md]( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jerik/mdCanvas/master/mdCanvas.md  )
- [leanCanvas including todolist ]( mdCanvas.html?md=mdCanvasWithTodo ) with [startup file: mdCanvasWithTodo.md]( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jerik/mdCanvas/master/mdCanvasWithTodo.md  )
- [leanCanvas]( mdCanvas.html?md=project ) with [project.md]( project.md ) ( Oops, will be rendered as html. Is owed by the behaviour of this wiki. )

## Getting started
1. Clone or download this github repository [jerik/mdCanvas]( https://github.com/jerik/mdCanvas )
